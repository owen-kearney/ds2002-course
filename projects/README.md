# Projects

As your final assignment you will be working in groups of 4-5 on a data pipeline project that connects key learnings from all course modules. The final project submission includes a visualization of the system design, code, and short answers to a set of questions that demonstrate your conceptual understanding.

You get to choose from a few project options. The specific project instructions will be released after you have progressed through modules 1-3 which provide the foundation for your project work. 

The release of project information will be announced on Canvas and in class.

When released, discuss project options in your group and choose one for your final assignment.
