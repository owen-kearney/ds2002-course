# Lab 02: Git & GitHub

Follow all the steps below for practice using GitHub. You an use your web browser to complete these steps, or the terminal if you like.

## Tasks: Git/GitHub Basics

When setting up `git` CLI authentication, I suggest setting up personal access token, see [Setup instructions](../setup/README.md). If you have this set up already, you do not need to change.

To test your understanding, go through these steps:

- Create a new repository in GitHub. You can do that by either cloning it to your local machine or by starting a Codespace instance from your new repository.  
- Create at least three new files. The files can be in Markdown, plain text, or csv format. 
- Use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push/pull` to sync your changes with your GitHub repository.
- Edit at least two of the files and go through another `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` cycle.
- While you working in your repository, experiment with the `git diff`, `git log` and `git status` commands and observe how they report changes to files and status of your repository.

If you need some pointers, review lectures, the [Git & GitHub practice section](../../practice/03-git/README.md), or materials presented in [Git Basics for Data Science](https://uvads.github.io/git-basics/) and work through pages 0, 1, and 2. 

**Optional:** For an additional challenge, create a new branch and add an extra file to it. Push the new branch to your GitHub repository.

## Submit your work

Copy and paste the URL of the repository you created into Canvas.
